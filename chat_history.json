        "question": "can you summarise everything?",
        "response": "A post-debate survey suggests that Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump 63% to 37% in a presidential debate. The survey was conducted by SSRS, an independent research firm, for CNN. Prior to the debate, a poll by The New York Times and Siena College had shown both candidates were neck-and-neck in the race. However, after the debate, 96% of Harris supporters who watched the debate said that their candidate had done a better job, while only 69% of Trump supporters said he did better. Harris is said to have baited Trump into angry responses on issues ranging from abortion to foreign policy. Despite this, Trump claimed it was his \"best debate\". Harris' campaign has challenged him for a second debate in October. After the debate, Harris also earned the endorsement of pop star Taylor Swift."
