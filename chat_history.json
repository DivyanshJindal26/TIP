        "question": "SUMMARISE IT",
        "response": "A post-debate survey suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed Donald Trump in a presidential debate, with 63% of viewers favoring Harris and 37% favoring Trump. The survey was conducted by SSRS, an independent research firm, for CNN. Prior to the debate, a poll showed both candidates were evenly matched. Harris is said to have provoked Trump into angry responses on various issues, from abortion to foreign policy. Despite this, Trump claimed it was his \"best debate\". Harris' campaign has challenged him for a second debate in October. The survey also revealed that viewers were divided over which candidate understands their problems better, with a slight edge to Harris. However, Trump was seen as better equipped to handle immigration and the role of commander-in-chief.\n"
