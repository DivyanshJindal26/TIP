The article discusses a series of protests in Kolkata, India, following the rape and murder of a doctor at R G Kar Hospital. The city has seen over 300 major rallies in the month since the incident, many of them organized by women. Despite pleas from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for the protesters to return home, the city remains on high alert with barricades set up throughout. The protests are largely apolitical and are seen as a spontaneous response to the horrific crime."
