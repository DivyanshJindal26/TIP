The emoji to be added as the reaction is provided as an argument.\n\n2. {message.removeReaction;emoji;user;message}: This tag removes a reaction from a message. The emoji to be removed is provided as an argument.\n\n3. {message.removeReactions;emoji;message}: This tag removes all reactions from a message, optionally for a specific emoji.\n\n4. {message.reactions}: This tag gets a list of reactions from a message. It returns an array of objects, each object representing a reaction with its count, whether the bot has reacted with this emoji, and the emoji details (id, whether it's animated, and its name)."
